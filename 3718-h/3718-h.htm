<h1>GEORGE WALKER AT SUEZ.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the spots on the
world&rsquo;s surface that I, George Walker, of Friday Street,
London, have ever visited, Suez in Egypt, at the head of the Red
Sea, is by far the vilest, the most unpleasant, and the least
interesting.&nbsp; There are no women there, no water, and no
vegetation.&nbsp; It is surrounded, and indeed often filled, by a
world of sand.&nbsp; A scorching sun is always overhead; and one
is domiciled in a huge cavernous hotel, which seems to have been
made purposely destitute of all the comforts of civilised
life.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in looking back upon the week of my
life which I spent there I always enjoy a certain sort of
triumph;&mdash;or rather, upon one day of that week, which lends
a sort of halo not only to my sojourn at Suez, but to the whole
period of my residence in Egypt.</p>
<p>I am free to confess that I am not a great man, and that, at
any rate in the earlier part of my career, I had a hankering
after the homage which is paid to greatness.&nbsp; I would fain
have been a popular orator, feeding myself on the incense
tendered to me by thousands; or failing that, a man born to
power, whom those around him were compelled to respect, and
perhaps to fear.&nbsp; I am not ashamed to acknowledge this, and
I believe that most of my neighbours in Friday Street would own
as much were they as candid and open-hearted as myself.</p>
<p>It is now some time since I was recommended to pass the first
four months of the year in Cairo because I had a
sore-throat.&nbsp; The doctor may have been right, but I shall
never divest myself of the idea that my partners wished to be rid
of me while they made certain changes in the management of the
firm.&nbsp; They would not otherwise have shown such interest
every time I blew my nose or relieved my huskiness by a slight
cough;&mdash;they would not have been so intimate with that
surgeon from St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s who dined with them twice at
the Albion; nor would they have gone to work directly that my
back was turned, and have done those very things which they could
not have done had I remained at home.&nbsp; Be that as it may, I
was frightened and went to Cairo, and while there I made a trip
to Suez for a week.</p>
<p>I was not happy at Cairo, for I knew nobody there, and the
people at the hotel were, as I thought, uncivil.&nbsp; It seemed
to me as though I were allowed to go in and out merely by
sufferance; and yet I paid my bill regularly every week.&nbsp;
The house was full of company, but the company was made up of
parties of twos and threes, and they all seemed to have their own
friends.&nbsp; I did make attempts to overcome that terrible
British exclusiveness, that noli me tangere with which an
Englishman arms himself; and in which he thinks it necessary to
envelop his wife; but it was in vain, and I found myself sitting
down to breakfast and dinner, day after day, as much alone as I
should do if I called for a chop at a separate table in the
Cathedral Coffee-house.&nbsp; And yet at breakfast and dinner I
made one of an assemblage of thirty or forty people.&nbsp; That I
thought dull.</p>
<p>But as I stood one morning on the steps before the hotel,
bethinking myself that my throat was as well as ever I remembered
it to be, I was suddenly slapped on the back.&nbsp; Never in my
life did I feel a more pleasant sensation, or turn round with
more unaffected delight to return a friend&rsquo;s
greeting.&nbsp; It was as though a cup of water had been handed
to me in the desert.&nbsp; I knew that a cargo of passengers for
Australia had reached Cairo that morning, and were to be passed
on to Suez as soon as the railway would take them, and did not
therefore expect that the greeting had come from any sojourner in
Egypt.&nbsp; I should perhaps have explained that the even tenor
of our life at the hotel was disturbed some four times a month by
a flight through Cairo of a flock of travellers, who like locusts
eat up all that there was eatable at the Inn for the day.&nbsp;
They sat down at the same tables with us, never mixing with us,
having their separate interests and hopes, and being often, as I
thought, somewhat loud and almost selfish in the expression of
them.&nbsp; These flocks consisted of passengers passing and
repassing by the overland route to and from India and Australia;
and had I nothing else to tell, I should delight to describe all
that I watched of their habits and manners&mdash;the outward
bound being so different in their traits from their brethren on
their return.&nbsp; But I have to tell of my own triumph at Suez,
and must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly
with my outstretched hand, I found it clasped by John
Robinson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Robinson, is this you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Holloa, Walker, what are you doing here?&rdquo;&nbsp; That
of course was the style of greeting.&nbsp; Elsewhere I should not
have cared much to meet John Robinson, for he was a man who had
never done well in the world.&nbsp; He had been in business and
connected with a fairly good house in Sise Lane, but he had
married early, and things had not exactly gone well with
him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the house broke, but he did; and
so he was driven to take himself and five children off to
Australia.&nbsp; Elsewhere I should not have cared to come across
him, but I was positively glad to be slapped on the back by
anybody on that landing-place in front of Shepheard&rsquo;s Hotel
at Cairo.</p>
<p>I soon learned that Robinson with his wife and children, and
indeed with all the rest of the Australian cargo, were to be
passed on to Suez that afternoon, and after a while I agreed to
accompany their party.&nbsp; I had made up my mind, on coming out
from England, that I would see all the wonders of Egypt, and
hitherto I had seen nothing.&nbsp; I did ride on one day some
fifteen miles on a donkey to see the petrified forest; but the
guide, who called himself a dragoman, took me wrong or cheated me
in some way.&nbsp; We rode half the day over a stony, sandy
plain, seeing nothing, with a terrible wind that filled my mouth
with grit, and at last the dragoman got off.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dere,&rdquo; said he, picking up a small bit of stone,
&ldquo;Dis is de forest made of stone.&nbsp; Carry that
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then we turned round and rode back to
Cairo.&nbsp; My chief observation as to the country was
this&mdash;that whichever way we went, the wind blew into our
teeth.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s work cost me five-and-twenty
shillings, and since that I had not as yet made any other
expedition.&nbsp; I was therefore glad of an opportunity of going
to Suez, and of making the journey in company with an
acquaintance.</p>
<p>At that time the railway was open, as far as I remember,
nearly half the way from Cairo to Suez.&nbsp; It did not run four
or five times a day, as railways do in other countries, but four
or five times a month.&nbsp; In fact, it only carried passengers
on the arrival of these flocks passing between England and her
Eastern possessions.&nbsp; There were trains passing backwards
and forwards constantly, as I perceived in walking to and from
the station; but, as I learned, they carried nothing but the
labourers working on the line, and the water sent into the Desert
for their use.&nbsp; It struck me forcibly at the time that I
should not have liked to have money in that investment.</p>
<p>Well; I went with Robinson to Suez.&nbsp; The journey, like
everything else in Egypt, was sandy, hot, and unpleasant.&nbsp;
The railway carriages were pretty fair, and we had room enough;
but even in them the dust was a great nuisance.&nbsp; We
travelled about ten miles an hour, and stopped about an hour at
every ten miles.&nbsp; This was tedious, but we had cigars with
us and a trifle of brandy and water; and in this manner the
railway journey wore itself away.&nbsp; In the middle of the
night, however, we were moved from the railway carriages into
omnibuses, as they were called, and then I was not
comfortable.&nbsp; These omnibuses were wooden boxes, placed each
upon a pair of wheels, and supposed to be capable of carrying six
passengers.&nbsp; I was thrust into one with Robinson, his wife
and five children, and immediately began to repent of my
good-nature in accompanying them.&nbsp; To each vehicle were
attached four horses or mules, and I must acknowledge that as on
the railway they went as slow as possible, so now in these
conveyances, dragged through the sand, they went as fast as the
beasts could be made to gallop.&nbsp; I remember the Fox Tally-ho
coach on the Birmingham road when Boyce drove it, but as regards
pace the Fox Tally-ho was nothing to these machines in
Egypt.&nbsp; On the first going off I was jolted right on to Mrs.
R. and her infant; and for a long time that lady thought that the
child had been squeezed out of its proper shape; but at last we
arrived at Suez, and the baby seemed to me to be all right when
it was handed down into the boat at Suez.</p>
<p>The Robinsons were allowed time to breakfast at that cavernous
hotel&mdash;which looked to me like a scheme to save the expense
of the passengers&rsquo; meal on board the ship&mdash;and then
they were off.&nbsp; I shook hands with him heartily as I parted
with him at the quay, and wished him well through all his
troubles.&nbsp; A man who takes a wife and five young children
out into a colony, and that with his pockets but indifferently
lined, certainly has his troubles before him.&nbsp; So he has at
home, no doubt; but, judging for myself, I should always prefer
sticking to the old ship as long as there is a bag of biscuits in
the locker.&nbsp; Poor Robinson!&nbsp; I have never heard a word
of him or his since that day, and sincerely trust that the baby
was none the worse for the little accident in the box.</p>
<p>And now I had the prospect of a week before me at Suez, and
the Robinsons had not been gone half an hour before I began to
feel that I should have been better off even at Cairo.&nbsp; I
secured a bedroom at the hotel&mdash;I might have secured sixty
bedrooms had I wanted them&mdash;and then went out and stood at
the front door, or gate.&nbsp; It is a large house, built round a
quadrangle, looking with one front towards the head of the Red
Sea, and with the other into and on a sandy, dead-looking, open
square.&nbsp; There I stood for ten minutes, and finding that it
was too hot to go forth, returned to the long cavernous room in
which we had breakfasted.&nbsp; In that long cavernous room I was
destined to eat all my meals for the next six days.&nbsp; Now at
Cairo I could, at any rate, see my fellow-creatures at their
food.&nbsp; So I lit a cigar, and began to wonder whether I could
survive the week.&nbsp; It was now clear to me that I had done a
very rash thing in coming to Suez with the Robinsons.</p>
<p>Somebody about the place had asked me my name, and I had told
it plainly&mdash;George Walker.&nbsp; I never was ashamed of my
name yet, and never had cause to be.&nbsp; I believe at this day
it will go as far in Friday Street as any other.&nbsp; A man may
be popular, or he may not.&nbsp; That depends mostly on
circumstances which are in themselves trifling.&nbsp; But the
value of his name depends on the way in which he is known at his
bank.&nbsp; I have never dealt in tea spoons or gravy spoons, but
my name will go as far as another name.&nbsp; &ldquo;George
Walker,&rdquo; I answered, therefore, in a tone of some little
authority, to the man who asked me, and who sat inside the gate
of the hotel in an old dressing-gown and slippers.</p>
<p>That was a melancholy day with me, and twenty times before
dinner did I wish myself back at Cairo.&nbsp; I had been
travelling all night, and therefore hoped that I might get
through some little time in sleeping, but the mosquitoes attacked
me the moment I laid myself down.&nbsp; In other places
mosquitoes torment you only at night, but at Suez they buzz
around you, without ceasing, at all hours.&nbsp; A scorching sun
was blazing overhead, and absolutely forbade me to leave the
house.&nbsp; I stood for a while in the verandah, looking down at
the few small vessels which were moored to the quay, but there
was no life in them; not a sail was set, not a boatman or a
sailor was to be seen, and the very water looked as though it
were hot.&nbsp; I could fancy the glare of the sun was cracking
the paint on the gunwales of the boats.&nbsp; I was the only
visitor in the house, and during all the long hours of the
morning it seemed as though the servants had deserted it.</p>
<p>I dined at four; not that I chose that hour, but because no
choice was given to me.&nbsp; At the hotels in Egypt one has to
dine at an hour fixed by the landlord, and no entreaties will
suffice to obtain a meal at any other.&nbsp; So at four I dined,
and after dinner was again reduced to despair.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the cavernous chamber almost mad at the
prospect of the week before me, when I heard a noise as of
various feet in the passage leading from the quadrangle.&nbsp;
Was it possible that other human beings were coming into the
hotel&mdash;Christian human beings at whom I could look, whose
voices I could hear, whose words I could understand, and with
whom I might possibly associate?&nbsp; I did not move, however,
for I was still hot, and I knew that my chances might be better
if I did not show myself over eager for companionship at the
first moment.&nbsp; The door, however, was soon opened, and I saw
that at least in one respect I was destined to be
disappointed.&nbsp; The strangers who were entering the room were
not Christians&mdash;if I might judge by the nature of the
garments in which they were clothed.</p>
<p>The door had been opened by the man in an old dressing-gown
and slippers, whom I had seen sitting inside the gate.&nbsp; He
was the Arab porter of the hotel, and as he marshalled the new
visitors into the room, I heard him pronounce some sound similar
to my own name, and perceived that he pointed me out to the most
prominent person of those who then entered the apartment.&nbsp;
This was a stout, portly man, dressed from head to foot in
Eastern costume of the brightest colours.&nbsp; He wore, not only
the red fez cap which everybody wears&mdash;even I had accustomed
myself to a fez cap&mdash;but a turban round it, of which the
voluminous folds were snowy white.&nbsp; His face was fat, but
not the less grave, and the lower part of it was enveloped in a
magnificent beard, which projected round it on all sides, and
touched his breast as he walked.&nbsp; It was a grand grizzled
beard, and I acknowledged at a moment that it added a singular
dignity to the appearance of the stranger.&nbsp; His flowing robe
was of bright colours, and the under garment which fitted close
round his breast, and then descended, becoming beneath his sash a
pair of the loosest pantaloons&mdash;I might, perhaps, better
describe them as bags&mdash;was a rich tawny silk.&nbsp; These
loose pantaloons were tied close round his legs, above the ankle,
and over a pair of scrupulously white stockings, and on his feet
he wore a pair of yellow slippers.&nbsp; It was manifest to me at
a glance that the Arab gentleman was got up in his best raiment,
and that no expense had been spared on his suit.</p>
<p>And here I cannot but make a remark on the personal bearing of
these Arabs.&nbsp; Whether they be Arabs or Turks, or Copts, it
is always the same.&nbsp; They are a mean, false, cowardly race,
I believe.&nbsp; They will bear blows, and respect the man who
gives them.&nbsp; Fear goes further with them than love, and
between man and man they understand nothing of forbearance.&nbsp;
He who does not exact from them all that he can exact is simply a
fool in their estimation, to the extent of that which he
loses.&nbsp; In all this, they are immeasurably inferior to us
who have had Christian teaching.&nbsp; But in one thing they beat
us.&nbsp; They always know how to maintain their personal
dignity.</p>
<p>Look at my friend and partner Judkins, as he stands with his
hands in his trousers pockets at the door of our house in Friday
Street.&nbsp; What can be meaner than his appearance?&nbsp; He is
a stumpy, short, podgy man; but then so also was my Arab friend
at Suez.&nbsp; Judkins is always dressed from head to foot in a
decent black cloth suit; his coat is ever a dress coat, and is
neither old nor shabby.&nbsp; On his head he carries a shining
new silk hat, such as fashion in our metropolis demands.&nbsp;
Judkins is rather a dandy than otherwise, piquing himself
somewhat on his apparel.&nbsp; And yet how mean is his
appearance, as compared with the appearance of that
Arab;&mdash;how mean also is his gait, how ignoble his
step!&nbsp; Judkins could buy that Arab out four times over, and
hardly feel the loss; and yet were they to enter a room together,
Judkins would know and acknowledge by his look that he was the
inferior personage.&nbsp; Not the less, should a personal quarrel
arise between them, would Judkins punch the Arab&rsquo;s head;
ay, and reduce him to utter ignominy at his feet.</p>
<p>Judkins would break his heart in despair rather than not
return a blow; whereas the Arab would put up with any indignity
of that sort.&nbsp; Nevertheless Judkins is altogether deficient
in personal dignity.&nbsp; I often thought, as the hours hung in
Egypt, whether it might not be practicable to introduce an
oriental costume in Friday Street.</p>
<p>At this moment, as the Arab gentleman entered the cavernous
coffee-room, I felt that I was greatly the inferior
personage.&nbsp; He was followed by four or five others, dressed
somewhat as himself; though by no means in such magnificent
colours, and by one gentleman in a coat and trousers.&nbsp; The
gentleman in the coat and trousers came last, and I could see
that he was one of the least of the number.&nbsp; As for myself,
I felt almost overawed by the dignity of the stout party in the
turban, and seeing that he came directly across the room to the
place where I was seated, I got upon my legs and made him some
sign of Christian obeisance.</p>
<p>I am a little man, and not podgy, as is Judkins, and I flatter
myself that I showed more deportment, at any rate, than he would
have exhibited.</p>
<p>I made, as I have said, some Christian obeisance.&nbsp; I
bobbed my head, that is, rubbing my hands together the while, and
expressed an opinion that it was a fine day.&nbsp; But if I was
civil, as I hope I was, the Arab was much more so.&nbsp; He
advanced till he was about six paces from me, then placed his
right hand open upon his silken breast,&mdash;and inclining
forward with his whole body, made to me a bow which Judkins never
could accomplish.&nbsp; The turban and the flowing robe might be
possible in Friday Street, but of what avail would be the outer
garments and mere symbols, if the inner sentiment of personal
dignity were wanting?&nbsp; I have often since tried it when
alone, but I could never accomplish anything like that bow.&nbsp;
The Arab with the flowing robe bowed, and the other Arabs all
bowed also; and after that the Christian gentleman with the coat
and trousers made a leg.&nbsp; I made a leg also, rubbing my
hands again, and added to my former remarks that it was rather
hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat berry true,&rdquo; said the porter in the dirty
dressing-gown, who stood by.&nbsp; I could see at a glance that
the manner of that porter towards me was greatly altered, and I
began to feel comforted in my wretchedness.&nbsp; Perhaps a
Christian from Friday Street, with plenty of money in his
pockets, would stand in higher esteem at Suez than at
Cairo.&nbsp; If so, that alone would go far to atone for the
apparent wretchedness of the place.&nbsp; At Cairo I had not
received that attention which had certainly been due to me as the
second partner in the flourishing Manchester house of Grimes,
Walker, and Judkins.</p>
<p>But now, as my friend with the beard again bowed to me, I felt
that this deficiency was to be made up.&nbsp; It was clear,
however, that this new acquaintance, though I liked the manner of
it, would be attended with considerable inconvenience, for the
Arab gentleman commenced an address to me in French.&nbsp; It has
always been to me a source of sorrow that my parents did not
teach me the French language, and this deficiency on my part has
given rise to an incredible amount of supercilious overbearing
pretension on the part of Judkins&mdash;who after all can hardly
do more than translate a correspondent&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; I do
not believe that he could have understood that Arab&rsquo;s
oration, but at any rate I did not.&nbsp; He went on to the end,
however, speaking for some three or four minutes, and then again
he bowed.&nbsp; If I could only have learned that bow, I might
still have been greater than Judkins with all his French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t exactly follow the French language when it is
spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! no French!&rdquo; said the Arab in very broken
English, &ldquo;dat is one sorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is it that
these fellows learn all languages under the sun?&nbsp; I
afterwards found that this man could talk Italian, and Turkish,
and Armenian fluently, and say a few words in German, as he could
also in English.&nbsp; I could not ask for my dinner in any other
language than English, if it were to save me from
starvation.&nbsp; Then he called to the Christian gentleman in
the pantaloons, and, as far as I could understand, made over to
him the duty of interpreting between us.&nbsp; There seemed,
however, to be one difficulty in the way of this being carried on
with efficiency.&nbsp; The Christian gentleman could not speak
English himself.&nbsp; He knew of it perhaps something more than
did the Arab, but by no means enough to enable us to have a
fluent conversation.</p>
<p>And had the interpreter&mdash;who turned out to be an Italian
from Trieste, attached to the Austrian Consulate at
Alexandria&mdash;had the interpreter spoken English with the
greatest ease, I should have had considerable difficulty in
understanding and digesting in all its bearings, the proposition
made to me.&nbsp; But before I proceed to the proposition, I must
describe a ceremony which took place previous to its
discussion.&nbsp; I had hardly observed, when first the
procession entered the room, that one of my friend&rsquo;s
followers&mdash;my friend&rsquo;s name, as I learned afterwards,
was Mahmoud al Ackbar, and I will therefore call him
Mahmoud&mdash;that one of Mahmoud&rsquo;s followers bore in his
arms a bundle of long sticks, and that another carried an iron
pot and a tray.&nbsp; Such was the case, and these two followers
came forward to perform their services, while I, having been
literally pressed down on to the sofa by Mahmoud, watched them in
their progress.&nbsp; Mahmoud also sat down, and not a word was
spoken while the ceremony went on.&nbsp; The man with the sticks
first placed on the ground two little pans&mdash;one at my feet,
and then one at the feet of his master.&nbsp; After that he
loosed an ornamented bag which he carried round his neck, and
producing from it tobacco, proceeded to fill two pipes.&nbsp;
This he did with the utmost gravity, and apparently with very
peculiar care.&nbsp; The pipes had been already fixed at one end
of the stick, and to the other end the man had fastened two large
yellow balls.&nbsp; These, as I afterwards perceived, were
mouth-pieces made of amber.&nbsp; Then he lit the pipes, drawing
up the difficult smoke by long painful suckings at the
mouthpiece, and then, when the work had become apparently easy,
he handed one pipe to me, and the other to his master.&nbsp; The
bowls he had first placed in the little pans on the ground.</p>
<p>During all this time no word was spoken, and I was left
altogether in the dark as to the cause which had produced this
extraordinary courtesy.&nbsp; There was a stationary
sofa&mdash;they called it there a divan&mdash;which was fixed
into the corner of the room, and on one side of the angle sat
Mahmoud al Ackbar, with his feet tucked under him, while I sat on
the other.&nbsp; The remainder of the party stood around, and I
felt so little master of the occasion, that I did not know
whether it would become me to bid them be seated.&nbsp; I was not
master of the entertainment.&nbsp; They were not my pipes.&nbsp;
Nor was it my coffee, which I saw one of the followers preparing
in a distant part of the room.&nbsp; And, indeed, I was much
confused as to the management of the stick and amber mouth-piece
with which I had been presented.&nbsp; With a cigar I am as much
at home as any man in the City.&nbsp; I can nibble off the end of
it, and smoke it to the last ash, when I am three parts
asleep.&nbsp; But I had never before been invited to regale
myself with such an instrument as this.&nbsp; What was I to do
with that huge yellow ball?&nbsp; So I watched my new friend
closely.</p>
<p>It had manifestly been a part of his urbanity not to commence
till I had done so, but seeing my difficulty he at last raised
the ball to his mouth and sucked at it.&nbsp; I looked at him and
envied the gravity of his countenance, and the dignity of his
demeanour.&nbsp; I sucked also, but I made a sputtering noise,
and must confess that I did not enjoy it.&nbsp; The smoke curled
gracefully from his mouth and nostrils as he sat there in mute
composure.&nbsp; I was mute as regarded speech, but I coughed as
the smoke came from me in convulsive puffs.&nbsp; And then the
attendant brought us coffee in little tin cups&mdash;black
coffee, without sugar and full of grit, of which the berries had
been only bruised, not ground.&nbsp; I took the cup and swallowed
the mixture, for I could not refuse, but I wish that I might have
asked for some milk and sugar.&nbsp; Nevertheless there was
something very pleasing in the whole ceremony, and at last I
began to find myself more at home with my pipe.</p>
<p>When Mahmoud had exhausted his tobacco, and perceived that I
also had ceased to puff forth smoke, he spoke in Italian to the
interpreter, and the interpreter forthwith proceeded to explain
to me the purport of this visit.&nbsp; This was done with much
difficulty, for the interpreter&rsquo;s stock of English was very
scanty&mdash;but after awhile I understood, or thought I
understood, as follows:&mdash;At some previous period of my
existence I had done some deed which had given infinite
satisfaction to Mahmoud al Ackbar.&nbsp; Whether, however, I had
done it myself, or whether my father had done it, was not quite
clear to me.&nbsp; My father, then some time deceased, had been a
wharfinger at Liverpool, and it was quite possible that Mahmoud
might have found himself at that port.&nbsp; Mahmoud had heard of
my arrival in Egypt, and had been given to understand that I was
coming to Suez&mdash;to carry myself away in the ship, as the
interpreter phrased it.&nbsp; This I could not understand, but I
let it pass.&nbsp; Having heard these agreeable tidings&mdash;and
Mahmoud, sitting in the corner, bowed low to me as this was
said&mdash;he had prepared for my acceptance a slight refection
for the morrow, hoping that I would not carry myself away in the
ship till this had been eaten.&nbsp; On this subject I soon made
him quite at ease, and he then proceeded to explain that as there
was a point of interest at Suez, Mahmoud was anxious that I
should partake of the refection somewhat in the guise of a
picnic, at the Well of Moses, over in Asia, on the other side of
the head of the Red Sea.&nbsp; Mahmoud would provide a boat to
take across the party in the morning, and camels on which we
would return after sunset.&nbsp; Or else we would go and return
on camels, or go on camels and return in the boat.&nbsp; Indeed
any arrangement would be made that I preferred.&nbsp; If I was
afraid of the heat, and disliked the open boat, I could be
carried round in a litter.&nbsp; The provisions had already been
sent over to the Well of Moses in the anticipation that I would
not refuse this little request.</p>
<p>I did not refuse it.&nbsp; Nothing could have been more
agreeable to me than this plan of seeing something of the sights
and wonders of this land,&mdash;and of this seeing them in good
company.&nbsp; I had not heard of the Well of Moses before, but
now that I learned that it was in Asia,&mdash;in another quarter
of the globe, to be reached by a transit of the Red Sea, to be
returned from by a journey on camels&rsquo; backs,&mdash;I burned
with anxiety to visit its waters.&nbsp; What a story would this
be for Judkins!&nbsp; This was, no doubt, the point at which the
Israelites had passed.&nbsp; Of those waters had they
drunk.&nbsp; I almost felt that I had already found one of
Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariot wheels.&nbsp; I readily gave my assent,
and then, with much ceremony and many low salaams, Mahmoud and
his attendant left me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very glad that I came to
Suez,&rdquo; said I to myself.</p>
<p>I did not sleep much that night, for the mosquitoes of Suez
are very persevering; but I was saved from the agonising despair
which these animals so frequently produce, by my agreeable
thoughts as to Mahmoud al Ackbar.&nbsp; I will put it to any of
my readers who have travelled, whether it is not a painful thing
to find one&rsquo;s-self regarded among strangers without any
kindness or ceremonious courtesy.&nbsp; I had on this account
been wretched at Cairo, but all this was to be made up to me at
Suez.&nbsp; Nothing could be more pleasant than the whole conduct
of Mahmoud al Ackbar, and I determined to take full advantage of
it, not caring overmuch what might be the nature of those
previous favours to which he had alluded.&nbsp; That was his
look-out, and if he was satisfied, why should not I be so
also?</p>
<p>On the following morning I was dressed at six, and, looking
out of my bed-room, I saw the boat in which we were to be wafted
into Asia being brought up to the quay close under my
window.&nbsp; It had been arranged that we should start early, so
as to avoid the mid-day sun, breakfast in the boat,&mdash;Mahmoud
in this way engaged to provide me with two refections,&mdash;take
our rest at noon in a pavilion which had been built close upon
the well of the patriarch, and then eat our dinner, and return
riding upon camels in the cool of the evening.&nbsp; Nothing
could sound more pleasant than such a plan; and knowing as I did
that the hampers of provisions had already been sent over, I did
not doubt that the table arrangements would be excellent.&nbsp;
Even now, standing at my window, I could see a basket laden with
long-necked bottles going into the boat, and became aware that we
should not depend altogether for our morning repast on that
gritty coffee which my friend Mahmoud&rsquo;s followers
prepared.</p>
<p>I had promised to be ready at six, and having carefully
completed my toilet, and put a clean collar and comb into my
pocket ready for dinner, I descended to the great gateway and
walked slowly round to the quay.&nbsp; As I passed out, the
porter greeted me with a low obeisance, and walking on, I felt
that I stepped the ground with a sort of dignity of which I had
before been ignorant.&nbsp; It is not, as a rule, the man who
gives grace and honour to the position, but the position which
confers the grace and honour upon the man.&nbsp; I have often
envied the solemn gravity and grand demeanour of the Lord
Chancellor, as I have seen him on the bench; but I almost think
that even Judkins would look grave and dignified under such a
wig.&nbsp; Mahmoud al Ackbar had called upon me and done me
honour, and I felt myself personally capable of sustaining before
the people of Suez the honour which he had done me.</p>
<p>As I walked forth with a proud step from beneath the portal, I
perceived, looking down from the square along the street, that
there was already some commotion in the town.&nbsp; I saw the
flowing robes of many Arabs, with their backs turned towards me,
and I thought that I observed the identical gown and turban of my
friend Mahmoud on the back and head of a stout short man, who was
hurrying round a corner in the distance.&nbsp; I felt sure that
it was Mahmoud.&nbsp; Some of his servants had failed in their
preparations, I said to myself, as I made my way round to the
water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; This was only another testimony how
anxious he was to do me honour.</p>
<p>I stood for a while on the edge of the quay looking into the
boat, and admiring the comfortable cushions which were
luxuriously arranged around the seats.&nbsp; The men who were at
work did not know me, and I was unnoticed, but I should soon take
my place upon the softest of those cushions.&nbsp; I walked
slowly backwards and forwards on the quay, listening to a hum of
voices that came to me from a distance.&nbsp; There was clearly
something stirring in the town, and I felt certain that all the
movement and all those distant voices were connected in some way
with my expedition to the Well of Moses.&nbsp; At last there came
a lad upon the walk dressed in Frank costume, and I asked him
what was in the wind.&nbsp; He was a clerk attached to an English
warehouse, and he told me that there had been an arrival from
Cairo.</p>
<p>He knew no more than that, but he had heard that the omnibuses
had just come in.&nbsp; Could it be possible that Mahmoud al
Ackbar had heard of another old acquaintance, and had gone to
welcome him also?</p>
<p>At first my ideas on the subject were altogether
pleasant.&nbsp; I by no means wished to monopolise the delights
of all those cushions, nor would it be to me a cause of sorrow
that there should be some one to share with me the conversational
powers of that interpreter.&nbsp; Should another guest be found,
he might also be an Englishman, and I might thus form an
acquaintance which would be desirable.&nbsp; Thinking of these
things, I walked the quay for some minutes in a happy state of
mind; but by degrees I became impatient, and by degrees also
disturbed in my spirit.&nbsp; I observed that one of the Arab
boatmen walked round from the vessel to the front of the hotel,
and that on his return he looked at me&mdash;as I thought, not
with courteous eyes.&nbsp; Then also I saw, or rather heard, some
one in the verandah of the hotel above me, and was conscious that
I was being viewed from thence.&nbsp; I walked and walked, and
nobody came to me, and I perceived by my watch that it was seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The noise, too, had come nearer and nearer,
and I was now aware that wheels had been drawn up before the
front door of the hotel, and that many voices were speaking
there.&nbsp; It might be that Mahmoud should wait for some other
friend, but why did he not send some one to inform me?&nbsp; And
then, as I made a sudden turn at the end of the quay, I caught
sight of the retreating legs of the Austrian interpreter, and I
became aware that he had been sent down, and had gone away,
afraid to speak to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; said I
to myself, &ldquo;I can but keep my ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; I owned
that I feared to go round to the front of the hotel.&nbsp; So I
still walked slowly up and down the length of the quay, and began
to whistle to show that I was not uneasy.&nbsp; The Arab sailors
looked at me uncomfortably, and from time to time some one peered
at me round the corner.&nbsp; It was now fully half-past seven,
and the sun was becoming hot in the heavens.&nbsp; Why did we not
hasten to place ourselves beneath the awning in that boat.</p>
<p>I had just made up my mind that I would go round to the front
and penetrate this mystery, when, on turning, I saw approaching
to me a man dressed at any rate like an English gentleman.&nbsp;
As he came near to me, he raised his hat, and accosted me in our
own language.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. George Walker, I believe?&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, with some little attempt at a high
demeanour,&mdash;&ldquo;of the firm of Grimes, Walker, and
Judkins, Friday Street, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most respectable house, I am sure,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid there has been a little mistake
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mistake as to the respectability of that
house,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; I felt that I was again alone in the
world, and that it was necessary that I should support
myself.&nbsp; Mahmoud al Ackbar had separated himself from me for
ever.&nbsp; Of that I had no longer a doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, none at all,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But about
this little expedition over the water;&rdquo; and he pointed
contemptuously to the boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has been a mistake
about that, Mr. Walker; I happen to be the English Vice-Consul
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took off my hat and bowed.&nbsp; It was the first time I had
ever been addressed civilly by any English consular
authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they have made me get out of bed to come down here
and explain all this to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a man of the world, I know, and I&rsquo;ll just
tell it you plainly.&nbsp; My old friend, Mahmoud al Ackbar, has
mistaken you for Sir George Walker, the new Lieutenant-Governor
of Pegu.&nbsp; Sir George Walker is here now; he has come this
morning; and Mahmoud is ashamed to face you after what has
occurred.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t object to withdraw with me
into the hotel, I&rsquo;ll explain it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt as though a thunderbolt had fallen; and I must say,
that even up to this day I think that the Consul might have been
a little less abrupt.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can get in here,&rdquo;
said he, evidently in a hurry, and pointing to a small door which
opened out from one corner of the house to the quay.&nbsp; What
could I do but follow him?&nbsp; I did follow him, and in a few
words learned the remainder of the story.&nbsp; When he had once
withdrawn me from the public walk he seemed but little anxious
about the rest, and soon left me again alone.&nbsp; The facts, as
far as I could learn them, were simply these.</p>
<p>Sir George Walker, who was now going out to Pegu as Governor,
had been in India before, commanding an army there.&nbsp; I had
never heard of him before, and had made no attempt to pass myself
off as his relative.&nbsp; Nobody could have been more innocent
than I was&mdash;or have received worse usage.&nbsp; I have as
much right to the name as he has.&nbsp; Well; when he was in
India before, he had taken the city of Begum after a terrible
siege&mdash;Begum, I think the Consul called it; and Mahmoud had
been there, having been, it seems, a great man at Begum, and Sir
George had spared him and his money; and in this way the whole
thing had come to pass.&nbsp; There was no further explanation
than that.&nbsp; The rest of it was all transparent.&nbsp;
Mahmoud, having heard my name from the porter, had hurried down
to invite me to his party.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; But why
had he been afraid to face me in the morning?&nbsp; And, seeing
that the fault had all been his, why had he not asked me to join
the expedition?&nbsp; Sir George and I may, after all, be
cousins.&nbsp; But, coward as he was, he had been afraid of
me.&nbsp; When they found that I was on the quay, they had been
afraid of me, not knowing how to get rid of me.&nbsp; I wish that
I had kept the quay all day, and stared them down one by one as
they entered the boat.&nbsp; But I was down in the mouth, and
when the Consul left me, I crept wearily back to my bedroom.</p>
<p>And the Consul did leave me almost immediately.&nbsp; A faint
hope had, at one time, come upon me that he would have asked me
to breakfast.&nbsp; Had he done so, I should have felt it as a
full compensation for all that I had suffered.&nbsp; I am not an
exacting man, but I own that I like civility.&nbsp; In Friday
Street I can command it, and in Friday Street for the rest of my
life will I remain.&nbsp; From this Consul I received no
civility.&nbsp; As soon as he had got me out of the way and
spoken the few words which he had to say, he again raised his hat
and left me.&nbsp; I also again raised mine, and then crept up to
my bed-room.</p>
<p>From my window, standing a little behind the white curtain, I
could see the whole embarkation.&nbsp; There was Mahmoud al
Ackbar, looking indeed a little hot, but still going through his
work with all that excellence of deportment which had graced him
on the preceding evening.&nbsp; Had his foot slipped, and had he
fallen backwards into that shallow water, my spirit would, I
confess, have been relieved.&nbsp; But, on the contrary,
everything went well with him.&nbsp; There was the real Sir
George, my namesake and perhaps my cousin, as fresh as paint,
cool from the bath which he had been taking while I had been
walking on that terrace.&nbsp; How is it that these governors and
commanders-in-chief go through such a deal of work without
fagging?&nbsp; It was not yet two hours since he was jolting
about in that omnibus-box, and there he had been all night.&nbsp;
I could not have gone off to the Well of Moses immediately on my
arrival.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the dignity of the position that does
it.&nbsp; I have long known that the head of a firm must never
count on a mere clerk to get through as much work as he could do
himself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the interest in the matter that
supports the man.</p>
<p>They went, and Sir George, as I was well assured, had never
heard a word about me.&nbsp; Had he done so, is it probable that
he would have requested my attendance?</p>
<p>But Mahmoud and his followers no doubt kept their own counsel
as to that little mistake.&nbsp; There they went, and the gentle
rippling breeze filled their sail pleasantly, as the boat moved
away into the bay.&nbsp; I felt no spite against any of them but
Mahmoud.&nbsp; Why had he avoided me with such cowardice?&nbsp; I
could still see them when the morning tchibouk was handed to Sir
George; and, though I wished him no harm, I did envy him as he
lay there reclining luxuriously upon the cushions.</p>
<p>A more wretched day than that I never spent in my life.&nbsp;
As I went in and out, the porter at the gate absolutely scoffed
at me.&nbsp; Once I made up my mind to complain within the
house.&nbsp; But what could I have said of the dirty Arab?&nbsp;
They would have told me that it was his religion, or a national
observance, or meant for a courtesy.&nbsp; What can a man do, in
a strange country, when he is told that a native spits in his
face by way of civility?&nbsp; I bore it, I bore it&mdash;like a
man; and sighed for the comforts of Friday Street.</p>
<p>As to one matter, I made up my mind on that day, and I fully
carried out my purpose on the next: I would go across to the Well
of Moses in a boat.&nbsp; I would visit the coasts of Asia.&nbsp;
And I would ride back into Africa on a camel.&nbsp; Though I did
it alone, I would have my day&rsquo;s pleasuring.&nbsp; I had
money in my pocket, and, though it might cost me &pound;20, I
would see all that my namesake had seen.&nbsp; It did cost me the
best part of &pound;20; and as for the pleasuring, I cannot say
much for it.</p>
<p>I went to bed early that night, having concluded my bargain
for the morrow with a rapacious Arab who spoke English.&nbsp; I
went to bed early in order to escape the returning party, and was
again on the quay at six the next morning.&nbsp; On this
occasion, I stepped boldly into the boat the very moment that I
came along the shore.&nbsp; There is nothing in the world like
paying for what you use.&nbsp; I saw myself to the bottle of
brandy and the cold meat, and acknowledged that a cigar out of my
own case would suit me better than that long stick.&nbsp; The
long stick might do very well for a Governor of Pegu, but would
be highly inconvenient in Friday Street.</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to give an account of my day&rsquo;s
journey here, though perhaps I may do so some day.&nbsp; I did go
to the Well of Moses&mdash;if a small dirty pool of salt water,
lying high above the sands, can be called a well; I did eat my
dinner in the miserable ruined cottage which they graced by the
name of a pavilion; and, alas for my poor bones! I did ride home
upon a camel.&nbsp; If Sir George did so early, and started for
Pegu the next morning&mdash;and I was informed such was the
fact&mdash;he must have been made of iron.&nbsp; I laid in bed
the whole day suffering greviously; but I was told that on such a
journey I should have slakened my throat with oranges, and not
with brandy.</p>
<p>I survived those four terrible days which remained to me at
Suez, and after another month was once again in Friday
Street.&nbsp; I suffered greatly on the occasion; but it is some
consolation to me to reflect that I smoked a pipe of peace with
Mahmoud al Ackbar; that I saw the hero of Begum while journeying
out to new triumphs at Pegu; that I sailed into Asia in my own
yacht&mdash;hired for the occasion; and that I rode back into
Africa on a camel.&nbsp; Nor can Judkins, with all his
ill-nature, rob me of these remembrances.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
